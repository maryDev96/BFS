# BFS
The main purpose of this project is to investigte and implement BFS. One competition in the TT is to get out of a labyrinth as quickly as possible. Your task as the tournament supervisor is: given the labyrinth map, initial positions of the three competing wizzards and their speeds (in corridors per minute) predict which of them will reach the exit first. Assume that the magical wands used in the play are capable of guiding the wizards to the exit along a shortest possible path.
